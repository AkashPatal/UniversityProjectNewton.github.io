            <div id="text-data">Jawaharlal Nehru University was established in 1969 by an act of parliament.[6] It was named after Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister. G. Parthasarathy was the first vice-chancellor.[7] Prof. Moonis Raza was the Founder Chairman and Rector.[8][9] The bill for the establishment of Jawaharlal Nehru University was placed in the Rajya Sabha on 1 September 1965 by the then-Minister of Education, M. C. Chagla. During the discussion that followed, Bhushan Gupta, member of parliament, voiced the opinion that this should not be yet another university. New faculties should be created, including scientific socialism, and one thing that this university should ensure was to keep noble ideas in mind and provide accessibility to students from weaker sections of society. The JNU Bill was passed in Lok Sabha on 16 November 1966 and the JNU Act came into force on 22 April 1969.</div>
