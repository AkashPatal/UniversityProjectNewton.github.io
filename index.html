            <p>Overall, the college is awesome in every aspect.
                Placements: As the first batch of this course is going to pass out in 2023, we can't say anything about placements. But I guess that it is going to be very good. JNU is just next to IIT-D, so it will be very easy for companies to notice it.

                The teachers are best even for the minor courses. This is because JNU is multidisciplinary, and the best teachers of India are there for every course. The curriculum is awesome. We are being taught not only the technical subjects but also many other interdisciplinary courses like economics, IPR, law etc. JNU is going to produce the best engineers in the future.
